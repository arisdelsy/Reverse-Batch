First thing at boot up 
no scales but shows the selection for the customer
then is goes to the scales display with the recipe db underneath 
then you select a recipe and then it display a prompt for user entry 
how much agregate is going to be in the mix?
Note: at this point once the user enters the amount of agregate for the mix,
based on the recipe that is chosen, it will determine the target values for cement and total tons that need to be reached.

Then the batch starts




Data still missing from actual company for recipes: percentage amount of cement for each mix, whether the amount of water changes per recipe
Note: separate customer info from batch type into two separate databases (this way customer is not tied to a specific recipe or product)
